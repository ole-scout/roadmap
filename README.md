# OLE Scout public roadmap

In this repository, you can find the official [OLE Scout public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ole-scout/projects/4). Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Use the roadmap [discussions](https://github.com/ole-scout/roadmap/discussions) to [suggest new features](https://github.com/ole-scout/roadmap/discussions/categories/ideas) or [ask general questions](https://github.com/ole-scout/roadmap/discussions/categories/q-a). Or share your feedback with us more privately using [our website](https://ole-scout.com).

## Roadmap stages

Our development process is split into the following phases to help us better prioritize feature requests:

* *Planned*: planned features that have been sufficiently investigated to start implementing.

* *In Development*: features that we are currently actively working on, usually with a predicted *release target*

* *Released*: features that have been recently completed and are now available or in the process of being rolled out.

* *Proposals*: features that have been proposed but are not currently being considered for implementation.

Please note that any indications about proposed or unfished features are only provided to offer transparency into our development process to our existing customers. If you need us to implement a feature or commit to providing a feature by a given date, please contact our sales team using [our website](https://ole-scout.com) for a formal quote.
